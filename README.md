# Yummyinmytummy - React Recipe Search Website 
[Live Version](https://yummyinmytummy.netlify.app/)
> Recipe search website build with ReactJS, using "Edamam" API

## General info
React recipe website, using an external api ("Edamam") to fetch data.
I wanted to explore the possibilities with a fetch api, and I though a recipe site is a good way to do so. 
Aside from the cute design, the site gives the user a big recipe source with detailed list of recipes, calories and servings.
The original recipe url is also available for more information.

I've learned a lot when building this app.
It was a struggle to keep finding the next error with the api, but in the end everything is working great.
The problem I spend most of my time on was to transfer the data between the components.
But overall I'm happy with the final result :)
